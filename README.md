# Presentations & Talks

This repository collects my educational and academic presentations about embedded systems, on-device AI, and human-centered technology.

Each presentation focuses on explaining complex engineering topics in a clear, structured way â€” combining hardware, software, and applied intelligence.

## 2025 â€” Quantum Technologies Explained

**Summary**  
A short-form educational video series designed to make quantum physics accessible through storytelling and real-world analogies.  
In under two minutes, each episode unpacks complex ideas â€”from **quantum entanglement** and **vacuum energy**, to **waveâ€“particle duality**, **quantum metrology**, and even the **atomic origins of fireworksâ€™ colors**â€” showing how quantum principles quietly shape the world around us.  
The project highlights how modern physics is not distant or abstract, but deeply woven into everyday life.

ðŸ“Š *As of October 14, 2025, the videos had reached 12,117 total views on TikTok*, reflecting genuine public curiosity for science explained with creativity and clarity.

**Collaboration**  
With **Luis Guillermo Vaca RincÃ³n**, for the course *TecnologÃ­as CuÃ¡nticas (UNAL 2025-I)*.
